\section*{1.1 Probability spaces, measures, and $\sigma$-algebras}

\subsection*{Problem 1.1.4}

Let $(\Omega, \F, \prob)$ be a probability space and $A, B, A_i$ events in $\F$. Prove the following properties of every probability measure.

\subsubsection*{a}

Monotonicity: If $A \subset B$ then $\prob(A) \leq \prob(B)$.

If $A$ is not a proper subset of $B$, then $A=B$ and equality follows because $\prob$ is a function. Otherwise, $A$ partitions $B$ into $A$ and $B \backslash A$. Then by countable subadditivity,

\[
\prob(B) = \prob(A) + \prob(B \backslash A) \geq \prob(A)
\]

by the nonnegativity of measure.

\subsubsection*{b}

Sub-additivity:

\[
A \subset \cup_i A_i \longrightarrow \prob(A) \leq \sum_i \prob(A_i)
\]

Let $B_i = \cup_{k=1}^i A_k$, and $C_i = B_i - B_{i-1}$, letting $B_0 = \emptyset$. Then $\cup_i A_i = \cup_i C_i$, and $A \subset \cup_i C_i$. By monotonicity, $\prob(A) \leq \prob(\cup_i C_i)$. Since the $C_i$ are disjoint, $\prob(\cup_i C_i) = \sum_{i=1} \prob(C_i)$. Since $C_i = \cup_{j=1}^i A_j - \cup_{k=1}^{i-1}A_k$, $C_i \subset A_i$, so by monotonicity,

\[
\prob(A) \leq \sum_{i=1} \prob(C_i) \leq \sum_{i=1} \prob(A_i)
\]

\subsubsection*{c}

Continuity from Below:

$A_i \uparrow A$ implies $\prob(A_i) \uparrow \prob(A)$.

Note that $\prob(A_i)$ is weakly increasing.

Define $B_i = A_i - A_{i-1}$, and let $A_0 = \emptyset$. Then $A_i = \cup_{k=1}^i B_i$. Then by disjointedness $\prob(A_i) = \sum_{k=1}^i \prob(B_k)$ implies

\[
A = \cup_{i=1}^\infty = \cup_{i=1}^\infty \cup_{k=1}^i B_k = \cup_{i=1}^\infty
\]

and by countable additivity,

\[
\prob(A) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \prob(B_k)
\]

Since the range of $\prob$ is $[0, 1]$, $|\prob(A)| < \infty$ and the series $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \prob(B_k)$ converges to $\prob(A)$. Since $A_i = \cup_{k=1}^i B_k$, $\prob(A_i)$ is the $i$th partial sum of the $\prob(B_k)$ series, which converges. Thus the $\prob(A_i)$ sequence converges to $\prob(A)$.

\subsubsection*{d}

Continuity from Above:

$A_i \downarrow A, \cap_i^\infty A_i = A$ implies $\prob(A_i) \downarrow A$.

Consider $A_i^C$. The $A_i^C$ are increasing sets because the $A_i$ are decreasing. $\cap_{i=1}^\infty A_i = A$ implies $A^C = (\cap_{i=1}^\infty A_i)^C = \cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i^C$. By continuity from below, $\prob(A_i^C) \uparrow \prob(A^C)$. Because $\prob(\Omega) = 1$, this implies $\prob(A_i) \downarrow \prob(A)$ as desired. 

\subsection*{Problem 1.1.5}

Prove that a finitely additive non-negative set function $\mu$ on a measurable space $(\Omega, \F)$ with the 'continuity' property

\[
B_n \subset \F, B_n \downarrow \emptyset, \mu(B_n) < \infty \longrightarrow \mu(B_n) \rightarrow 0
\]

must be countably additive if $\mu(\Omega) < \infty$. Give an example that it is not necessarily so when $\mu(\Omega) = \infty$.

Let $A_n \in \F$ be a countable collection of disjoint, measurable sets. Let $B_k = \cup_{i=k}^\infty A_i$.

Since sigma-algebras are closed under countable union, $B_k \in \F$ for all $k \in \N$. Since $\mu(\Omega) < \infty$, monotonicity implies that $\mu(B_k) < \infty$.

\begin{lemma}
$B_k \downarrow \emptyset$.

\begin{proof}
The limit suupremum of $B_k$ is the set of points $x$ such that $x \in B_k$ for infinitely many $k$. I will show this set is empty.

$B_k$ is the union of disjoint sets $A_i$, so $x \in B_k$ for some $k$ implies that $x \in A_j$ for some $j \in \N$. This then implies that $x \in B_k$ for $k \leq k$, and $x \not\in B_k$ for $k > j$. Thus $x$ is only in a finite number of $B_k$. Thus $\limsup B_k = \emptyset$. Since $\liminf B_k \subset \limsup B_k$ and the only subset of the empty set is the empty set, $\limsup B_k = \emptyset$. Since the upper and lower limit equal each other, $\lim B_k = \emptyset$. Since the $B_k$ are weakly decreasing, the lemma is proved.
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

We will now prove the main result. For all $n \in \N$, finite additivity means

\[
\prob(\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n \prob(A_i) + \prob(\cup_{i=n+1}^\infty A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n \prob(A_i) + \prob(B_{n+1})
\]

Taking limits, the last term goes to zero, leaving

\[
\prob(\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \prob(A_i)
\]

as desired.

For an example of how this breaks down when $\mu(\Omega) = \infty$, let $\Omega = \N$, $\F = 2^\N$, and $\mu$ be finitely-additive with $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$ and the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
\item If $A_n \in \F$ is an event such that $A$ is a singleton that only contains $n \in N$, then $\mu(A_n) = \frac{1}{2^n}$.
\item If $A \in \F$ is infinite, $\mu(A) = \infty$.
\end{itemize}

Thus, $\mu(\cup_{i=1}^\infty A_i) = \mu(\Omega) = \infty$, but $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n \mu(A_i) = 2$. Thus $\mu$ is not countably additive.
